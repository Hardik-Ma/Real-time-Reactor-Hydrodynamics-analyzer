# Experimental Data analysis for understanding the Hydrodynamics of the Coiled Flow Inverter Reactor

This file uses the cvv data generated by the experiments to understand the hydrodynamics of the CFI Reactor using Calculating and analyzing the Mean Residence time, Variance, Dispersion Number, Disperssion coeffecient, peclet Number and skewness of the RTD Curve.
